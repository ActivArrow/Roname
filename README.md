Hey, Arrow here.
I made this because pretty much every Roblox player was pissed when Roblox renamed "Friends" to "Connections". I was also pissed and said to myself "What if i built a extension to revert the name change?", and that's how i spent 1 hour learning to build an extension, and another 30 minutes to actually build it. Hope you enjoy.

incase you don't know how to actually add the extension:
1. go to chrome://extensions
2. Turn on Developer mode
3. Load the folder and it should work
